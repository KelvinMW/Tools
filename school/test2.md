You are absolutely right. I apologize for the trouble with the link. My apologies, as a language model, I can't create and share live, editable files directly.

Instead, here is the complete content of the presentation laid out slide-by-slide. You can easily copy and paste this text into your own Google Slides, PowerPoint, or other presentation software. I've also included descriptions for finding suitable images for each slide.

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

*   **TITLE:** What Languages Do Computers Speak?
*   **SUBTITLE:** High-Level vs. Low-Level Programming Languages
*   **TEXT BOX:** Your Name / Class Name
*   **TEXT BOX:** Date
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** A clean, modern background with abstract digital patterns or circuit board lines. Search for "tech background" or "digital abstract".

### **Slide 2: How Do We Talk to Computers?**

*   **TITLE:** How Do We Talk to Computers?
*   **BODY TEXT:**
    *   We talk to each other using languages like English, French, or Spanish.
    *   But how do we tell a computer what to do?
    *   Can we just say: "Computer, open Google Chrome"?
    *   No! Computers don't understand human languages directly.
    *   They need special "languages" called **PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES**.
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** An icon of a person on one side and a computer on the other, with a question mark or speech bubbles between them. Search for "person computer communication icon".

### **Slide 3: Analogy - Levels of Understanding**

*   **TITLE:** Analogy: Levels of Understanding
*   **BODY TEXT:**
    *   **Baby:** Very simple sounds, gestures. (Very Low-Level)
    *   **Dog:** Specific words, gestures ("Sit!"). (A bit higher level)
    *   **Friend:** Complex sentences, easy understanding. ("Meet me at the park at 3 PM.") (High-Level)
    *   Computers are similar! Some languages are easy for them but hard for us. Others are easy for us but need a "translator" for the computer.
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** Three simple icons side-by-side: a baby, a dog, and two people talking.

### **Slide 4: Low-Level Languages (LLL) - The Computer's Native Tongue**

*   **TITLE:** Low-Level Languages (LLL) - The Computer's Native Tongue
*   **LEFT SIDE TEXT:**
    *   **Imagine a Robot:** To pick up a pencil, you'd give tiny, exact steps:
        *   "Move arm forward"
        *   "Open claw"
        *   "Close claw"
        *   "Lift arm"
*   **RIGHT SIDE TEXT:**
    *   **Machine Code:** The real computer language is just 0s and 1s!
        *   Example: `01011010 11001001`
        *   Hard for humans to write or read.
        *   Very fast for the computer.
    *   **Assembly Language:** Uses short words (like `ADD`, `MOV`).
        *   Example: `ADD R1, R2`
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** An image of a robotic arm on the left, and a background of green or blue binary code (0s and 1s) on the right.

### **Slide 5: High-Level Languages (HLL) - Human-Friendly Coding**

*   **TITLE:** High-Level Languages (HLL) - Human-Friendly Coding
*   **BODY TEXT:**
    *   **Imagine a Smart Assistant:** Instead of tiny steps, you say: "Assistant, please pick up the pencil."
    *   High-Level Languages (HLL) are much closer to human language.
    *   **Examples:** Python, Scratch, Java, C++, JavaScript
    *   Look how easy this is to read!
        *   `print("Hello, Class!")` (Python)
        *   `console.log("Hello, World!");` (JavaScript)
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** Place the logos of several programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript on the slide.

### **Slide 6: Why Use HLLs? The "Translator"**

*   **TITLE:** Why Use HLLs? The "Translator"
*   **SUBTITLE:** If HLLs are easy for us, but computers only understand 0s and 1s... how does it work?
*   **BODY TEXT (Formatted as a flowchart):**
    *   **High-Level Code** (Easy for us)
    *   ⬇️
    *   **TRANSLATOR** (Compiler / Interpreter)
    *   ⬇️
    *   **Low-Level Code** (0s & 1s for computer)
    *   ⬇️
    *   **Computer** (Understands!)
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** A simple flowchart graphic that visually represents the text. Search for "code compiler flowchart icon".

### **Slide 7: HLL vs. LLL - Pros & Cons**

*   **TITLE:** HLL vs. LLL - Pros & Cons
*   **TABLE:** Create a 2x5 table.
| Feature | High-Level Languages (HLL) | Low-Level Languages (LLL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ease of Use** | Easy for humans to write and read | Very hard for humans to write and read |
| **Development** | Faster to create programs | Slower to create programs |
| **Portability**| Portable (runs on different computers) | Not Portable (specific to one computer) |
| **Speed** | Slightly slower (due to translation) | Very Fast (direct understanding) |
| **Control** | Less direct control over hardware | Direct control over hardware |
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** An icon of a balanced scale, or a simple "pros and cons" plus/minus icon.

### **Slide 8: Quick Check!**

*   **TITLE:** Quick Check!
*   **BODY TEXT:**
    *   1. Is **Python** a High-Level or Low-Level Language? Why?
    *   2. If you were telling a robot to "turn on the light":
        *   What would be a very **low-level** instruction?
        *   What would be a **high-level** instruction?
    *   3. Why do we use High-Level Languages if computers only understand Low-Level Languages?
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** A large, friendly question mark icon. Search for "question mark graphic".

### **Slide 9: Recap & Conclusion**

*   **TITLE:** Recap & Conclusion
*   **BODY TEXT:**
    *   Computers speak **programming languages**.
    *   **Low-Level Languages (LLL)** (Machine Code, Assembly) are hard for us but easy for computers.
    *   **High-Level Languages (HLL)** (Python, Scratch, Java) are easy for us but need a translator for the computer.
    *   HLLs make it possible for many people to create amazing software and apps!
*   **BOTTOM TEXT:** Thank you! Any Questions?
*   **IMAGE SUGGESTION:** A "thumbs up" icon, a checkmark, or a simple graphic that says "Thank You".
